To scrape companies data from Angellist,   
Just Execute main.py -> config.py -> scrape.py -> clean.py

For Singapore Companies only,  
Execute singaporeMain.py -> config.p-> scrape.py -> clean.py

Note: I would strongly recommend to view ipynb files in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org as the github rendering may failed at times.
